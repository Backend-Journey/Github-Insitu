## Some Github Features Hiding

###  OCTOCAT

- [www.myoctocat.com](myoctocat)

    This allows you to design your own octocat. Octocat is the official mascot.
    The character is a hybrid of an octopus and a cat that symbolizes github's 
    friendly and welcoming nature. I just designed my octocat and added as my 
    alternative github account's avatar.

### FORK AND CODESPACE

#### Fork

    To fork means to retrieve a copy of a repository from another author and 
    possess all the key information and features that repository has.

#### Github.dev 
    
    After forking, press __period__ (__.__) and this will open github.dev.
    
    
    **Github.dev** is an IDE that has does not have any compute attached to it
    and makes it really easy to start working with files. It opens an amazing 
    text editor looking like VS Code
