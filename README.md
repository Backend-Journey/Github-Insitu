## Some Github Features Hiding

###  OCTOCAT

- [www.myoctocat.com](myoctocat)

    This allows you to design your own octocat. Octocat is the official mascot.
    The character is a hybrid of an octopus and a cat that symbolizes github's 
    friendly and welcoming nature. I just designed my octocat and added as my 
    alternative github account's avatar.
